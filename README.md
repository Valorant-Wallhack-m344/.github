## 🧠 What is a Wallhack in Valorant?

A **wallhack** (a.k.a. ESP – Extra Sensory Perception) is a cheat overlay that **displays enemy player locations** through obstacles. It shows player models, skeletons, boxes, health, distance, weapon info — anything you want to track.

Unlike aimbots or triggerbots, wallhacks don’t shoot for you — they just **feed you info**. Play smarter, rotate earlier, peek with purpose.
